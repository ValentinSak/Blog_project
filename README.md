# Blog_project
This is my blog project I have made during my studies

It also contains:

- Django admin panel
- opportunity to share a post by email
- comments system
- tag system
- PostgreSQL database
- sitemap
- fulltext search
- user system
- authentication through google and github accounts
- user profile system
- django summernote WYSIWYG
- REST API using DRF (I know, that you don't need that in a blog, but in case of studies I hope it's ok)
- dynamic API scheme using .yml format
- dynamic API redoc and swagger-ui schemes
